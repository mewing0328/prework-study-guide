# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

To increase my marketing potential when I return to the workforce, I enrolled in a coding bootcamp course through George Washington University. As a coding bootcamp student, I need a study guide that I can quickly access and utilize throughout the course. When I need to reference notes about things I've learned in the past, I can utilize the study guide as a reference. I learned how to build out a website utilizing GitBash, GitHub, and VS Code.

## Usage

There are four sections in the study guide that includes notes. The sections are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.  For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
